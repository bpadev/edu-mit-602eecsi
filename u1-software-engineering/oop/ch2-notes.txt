Chapter 2: Learning to Program in Python


2.1 Using Python
    Python is designed for easy interaction between a user and the computer.

2.1.1 Indentation and line breaks
    Python uses colons for indented blocks, Python does not use semi-colons.

2.1.2 Types and declarations
    No variable declarations, and the same variable can be used at different points in your program to hold data objects of different types.
    This comes with pros and cons compared to a statically-typed language like Java.

2.1.3 Modules
    As you start to write bigger programs, you will want to keep the procedure definitions in multiple files, grouped together according to what they do.

2.1.4 Interaction and Debugging
    Write small pieces of code and test them.
    Think of edge cases when testing.
    Debug using print statements, use a variation of binary search to divide and conquer with print statements.

2.2 Procedures
    In Python the fundamental abstraction of a computation is as a procedure (other books called them functions instead).

2.3 Control Structures

2.3.1 Conditionals
    Booleans - true or false.
    If - if <booleanExpr> <statement>
    For and While - for <var> in <listExpr>:
